- is virtual mem from 0x0 to 0xffff...

// QUESTION: why send raw bytes in little endian?
    // it's interpretted as an address (pointing to an address that pts to an
    //unsigned long long). are addresses also stored in little-endian?

how to configure gdb so when I run the command, it automatically turns on intel syntax and such?

how to read stack views on gdb and binja? is the top the top of the stack or reversed (bc stack grows down)?
- on GDB, top is top (conceptual) of stack , aka lower memory addr

when you clobber the return address memory, do you clobber it in little-endian byte order?
- I need to draw out a diagram of what happens in memory when this happens

"stack isn't aligned correctly", crashing on XMMWORD PTR
- your stack should be aligned with the zero at the end
- "16-byte aligned" means the address must end in zero
- I'm just hearing noise at this point
- the stack needs to be aligned to a 16-byte boundary
- what does "align" mean
^ this led to us deciding we would clobber return addr to be win+5 instead of win in "stack" recitation

learn the order of what happens on the stack when a function gets called and when it ends
