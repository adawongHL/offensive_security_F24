## ðŸŸ¢ Quasar (50)
Question:
	This quasar is the brightest object in the universe.
        Can you guess the mass of the black hole at its center? (Ans is a hex num)
Solve:
	Run GDB on the quasar compiled binary file. Set assembly code to Intel style using`set disassembly-flavor intel`.  Set a breakpoint at main using `b main` and run the program. Run `disass` to see the assembly code of main. Notice the portion where user input is read:
		![[Captura de pantalla 2024-09-23 a las 15.51.42.png]]
		The flag is shown only if user input is correct. This means the cmp line must correspond to comparing user input and the correct answer, whose value we want to read. As per calling convention, the return value of a function is stored in register RAX. We trace the code and find that after user input is received, whatever is in RAX gets moved to [rbp-0x8]. This means [rbp-0x8] contains user input. Then, the absolute value 0x3f5476a00 gets moved into RAX. Afterwards, RAX's value gets compared with [rbp-0x8]. This indicates that the correct answer is the value 0x3f5476a00.
	Continue running the program and enter 0x3f5476a00 as the mass of the quasar. 
	Obtain the flag: flag{sc4la4r_v4lu3s_h1dd3n_1n_pl41ns1ght!_1ff1ac5ecebcf8f7}
	 DONE.
	
		




I can't ssh into my replacement-VM set up ytd after this sequence of action:
ssh into VM --> set up NYU VPN --> VPN sets up successfully --> freeze in terminal --> broken pipe error --> exits VM; back on local --> attempt to ssh into same VM again --> loads forever; timeout error

Am I meant to run tmux on my local first before ssh-ing into the VM? Or tmux is for when I am on the VM, prior to connecting to VPN?

## ðŸŸ¢ Cosmic Distance (50)
Find: 
	Can you tell me the distance from this quasar to Earth?
Solve:
	Use Binary Ninja to decompile the code. Notice this function that initializes the distance: 
		`void init()
		{
		    distance = 0x2cb417800;
		}`
		
	Run the program and enter 0x2cb417800 to obtain the flag.
	flag{0nly_tw3lv3_b1ll10n_l1ght_y34rs_4w4y!_c0f41fd12df66b5d}
	DONE.
