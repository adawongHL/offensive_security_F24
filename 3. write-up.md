# Disks Game 150
**Given:** "How many disks do you want to start with?"
**Theme: SAT Solver**
**Solve:**

Part 1 - Initial Recon on Binary Ninja
- Scope the purpose and flow of the program by inspecting main() on Binary Ninja
- We get the flag if process(userInput) != 0
- Head into process() to see what happens there.
- process()
	- one argument - we feed it userInput
	- we want the argument to be positive
	- calls recurse() function
		recurse(userInput, 0x53, 0x54, 0x41)x
	- we want total_moves to equal goal
- Since process() calls recurse(), let's head into recurse() to see what happens there.
- recurse()
	- takes in 4 arguments, all int_32
	- this is a recursive function that keeps calling itself until the first argument becomes zero


# ðŸŸ¢ Knapsack 150
**Given:** "Let's go shopping! How many of each would you like?"
**Theme: SAT Solver**

**Solve:**
Statically analyse the compiled binary using Binary Ninja. 
Head to main() to gain a general understanding of the program. 
Inside main(), we see a scanf() function that takes in 6 inputs, separated by hyphens. Conditions are listed after the input is read in. If any input is negative, the program returns the message "Nah, that's not how we count around here!" and will not deliver the flag. If the output from calling process() on all six inputs equals zero, that will also deny us the flag. Head to process() to see what it does. Inside process(), we see two conditions that evaluateÂ to zero, which means we should avoid these. We must ensure the sixth argument is greater than zero, and we must also ensure var_6 * arg6 + var_1 * arg1 + var_2 * arg2 + var_3 * arg3 + var_4 * arg4 + var_5 * arg5 = var_0, where var_0 to var_6 are hardcoded int-32 values. 

To engineer the desired input that will pass the conditions, we create a Python script using Z3 solver. Define variables and add to the solver object all the conditions that need to be true. 

Enter the output from Z3 script when prompted. Obtain flag:
flag{1ts_n0t_t0_b4d_s0lv1ng_pr0bl3ms_w1th_Z3!_c3d3d36a98a4c0db}

DONE.
