# ðŸŸ¢ Knapsack 150
**Given:** "Let's go shopping! How many of each would you like?"
**Theme: SAT Solver**

**Solve:**
Statically analyse the compiled binary using Binary Ninja. 
Head to main() to gain a general understanding of the program. 
Inside main(), we see a scanf() function that takes in 6 inputs, separated by hyphens. Conditions are listed after the input is read in. If any input is negative, the program returns the message "Nah, that's not how we count around here!" and will not deliver the flag. If the output from calling process() on all six inputs equals zero, that will also deny us the flag. Head to process() to see what it does. Inside process(), we see two conditions that evaluateÂ to zero, which means we should avoid these. We must ensure the sixth argument is greater than zero, and we must also ensure var_6 * arg6 + var_1 * arg1 + var_2 * arg2 + var_3 * arg3 + var_4 * arg4 + var_5 * arg5 = var_0, where var_0 to var_6 are hardcoded int-32 values. 

To engineer the desired input that will pass the conditions, we create a Python script using Z3 solver. Define variables and add to the solver object all the conditions that need to be true. 

Enter the output from Z3 script when prompted. Obtain flag:
flag{1ts_n0t_t0_b4d_s0lv1ng_pr0bl3ms_w1th_Z3!_c3d3d36a98a4c0db}

DONE.


# ðŸŸ¢ Flips 200
Goal:
- Enter a bunch of numbers correctly

Solve:
- Scope the program statically on Binary Ninja
- Head into main() to see what occurs
	- The program begins by calling a traversal() function. And if the fail flag equals zero, we get the flag. This means that within the traversal() function, something happens that could set the fail flag to one. We want to prevent that happening.
	- traversal() is called by passing in the address of node_0. This suggests we are traversing some linked list or tree structure. 
- Head into traversal()
	- Notice that it is recursive. 
	- First, we call traversal() on the input node plus 8 bytes. Then we ask for two user inputs: one unsigned int-64 and one signed int-64. Both get converted to an unsigned long within get_input()
	- Then, we check that the output from calling process() on the two user inputs is not equal to the input node dereferenced. If not equal, set the fail flag to one. This means we want them to equal. 
	- Afterwards, we call traversal() again on the input plus 16 bytes. 
	- The recursive calls suggest that we are traversing the left node, then processing the current node, and moving on to the right node. This implies a binary tree structure. Specifically, we're doing in-order traversal.
- Go into process() 
	- A variable is initialised to be zero. This acts as a counter.
	- In every iteration of the for-loop, we XOR the two input arguments. If the XOR-result is bitwise-ANDed with 1 and is true, we increment one to the counter. We right-shift the XOR-result by one step in the next iteration. 
	- Effectively, this is checking every corresponding bit-pairs in both input numbers. If they are different (XOR will be true, and bitwise-AND that with 1 gives us 1, otherwise 0), we add the count by one. The counter thus gives us how many bits differ in the two numbers. This is also known as the hamming distance between two numbers expressed in binary. 
- Combine findings from process() with traversal() to crystallise our goal
	- Our goal is for every node, we enter two numbers whose hamming distance equals to the value of that node. 
	- This requires us to first determine the order of node traversal, and for each node, determine what two numbers to enter.
- Let's determine the order of traversal through this binary tree.
	- This can be done by tracing the code. 
	- The first call to traversal() is made on node_0. Inside node_0, it calls traversal() on itself's address plus 8 bytes, which is node_1 (see .data section in decompiled code). Inside node_1's call, it further calls node_3. 
	- Continue this reasoning through the end. We end up with this order of traversal:
		- 3, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 8
- For each node, determine what two numbers to enter
	- Take node 3 as an example. Node 3 holds the value 0x0e in memory, which is 14 in decimal. We want to enter two numbers with exactly 14 bits that differ. The simplest way to do it is enter 0, then enter a number with exactly 14 1's, which equals 16383 in decimal. 
	- Side note on entering numbers: they should be inputted as decimal numbers instead of hex or binary. We know this from get_input(), where the input strings are specified to be interpretted as base-10 numbers. 
	- Apply the same reasoning for all nodes. Here are the results for the second number to enter (let the first number always be zero):
		- Node 3 - 16383
		- Node 1 - 8191
		- Node 4 - 524287
		- Node 0 - 262143
		- Node 5 - 131071
		- Node 2 - 262143
		- Node 7 - 1048575
		- Node 9 - 16383
		- Node 6 - 32767
		- Node 8 - 524287
- Run the program. Enter the numbers for each node when prompted - in order! 
- Obtain flag
- DONE!

**Given:** "How many disks do you want to start with?"
**Theme: SAT Solver**
**Solve:**

Part 1 - Initial Recon on Binary Ninja
- Scope the purpose and flow of the program by inspecting main() on Binary Ninja
- We get the flag if process(userInput) != 0
- Head into process() to see what happens there.
- process()
	- one argument - we feed it userInput
	- we want the argument to be positive
	- calls recurse() function
		recurse(userInput, 0x53, 0x54, 0x41)x
	- we want total_moves to equal goal
- Since process() calls recurse(), let's head into recurse() to see what happens there.
- recurse()
	- takes in 4 arguments, all int_32
	- this is a recursive function that keeps calling itself until the first argument becomes zero
