- bootloaders
- dynamically linked binaries

- Static vs dynamic linking
	- def (linking)
		- #include / import other files into your curr code file
	- static
		- link those files when I build (compile + link) rn
	- dynamic
		- link those files later - when the script is run 
- address space
- stack
	- stores function frames; local vars within functions
	- think of it as a temporary space
	- grows "downwards" - not physically downwards; from high addr space to lower add space
- heap
- virtual memory space
- offset
	- where main begins within the block of memory we call BINARY
- base address
	- the start addr of a program
- PIE 
	- randomizes the base addr

Gists

### glibc
