Problem:
nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1245

Please input your NetID (something like abc123): hw3172

hello, hw3172. Please wait a moment...

I found the raw bytes address of `totally_uninteresting_function` written somewhere: I"E"?U


Solve:
Let's abbreviate `totally_uninteresting_function`  to TUF. We can calculate the ADD address as follows:
- addr TUF = base + offset TUF
- base = addr TUF - offset TUF
- ADD addr = ADD offset + base

Therefore, we need to find ADD's offset, TUF's offset and TUF's address.

ADD's offset can be found using objdump:

objdump -d basic_math | grep -A 20 '<basic_math>'
![[Captura de pantalla 2024-09-17 a las 13.31.47.png]]
Look at the line with the ADD operation: its address is 0x1285. Since the executable is PIE, 0x1285 is ADD's offset. 

Next, let's find TUF's offset. Use readelf on the executable:
![[Captura de pantalla 2024-09-17 a las 14.08.14.png]]
TUF's offset is 0x1249

Lastly, let's parse the raw bytes that represent TUF's address. Use the following python script:
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "DEBUG"

p = remote("offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu", 1245)

p.recvuntil("abc123): ".encode())

p.sendline(b"hw3172")

p.recvuntil("somewhere: ".encode())


TUFaddr = p.recvuntil("\n".encode(), drop=True)

TUFaddr = p.recv(8)

print(TUFaddr)

p.recvuntil("> ".encode())

  
TUFoffset = 0x1249 # from symbol table gotten using readelf

  
baseAddr = int.from_bytes(TUFaddr, byteorder="little") - TUFoffset

baseAddrHex = hex(baseAddr)

print(f"base address in hex: {baseAddrHex}") # check it does end in 0x000

  

ADDoffset = 0x1285 # from objdump, looking into the assembly code within basic_math function

  
ADDaddr = baseAddr + ADDoffset


p.sendline(ADDaddr.to_bytes(8, byteorder="little"))

p.interactive()

Run this program and obtain the flag. 
Done!

(wasn't working when I was sending the answer as hex().encode())

Question: 
What is the address of the buffer the FLAG is read into?
(hint: it is zeroed out at the beginning of the function)

Solve:
Set breakpoint on main and run `disass` to see the assembly dump. Observe the line for running the get_flag() function. This function should return the flag's buffer address (which derefs to the flag itself). By calling convention, whatever a function returns gets put into the register rax. This means that to get the buffer address, we need to see what's inside of register rax at this moment in time. 

However, we can't just set a breakpoint at get_flag(), because this function gets called only if we input the correct answer for the buffer address where flag loads into. In other words, running the program on gdb and inputting the inevitably wrong address will not land us at this breakpoint. 

Observe the assembly code further where user input is read:

0x5619b2968322 <main+121>Â  Â  **call** Â  read_inputÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <read_input>

Â Â  0x5619b2968327 <main+126>Â  Â  movÂ  Â  qword ptr [rbp - 0x68], rax Â  Â  [0x7ffecb169b58] => 0x7ffecb169b60 â—‚â€” 0

Â Â  0x5619b296832b <main+130>Â  Â  leaÂ  Â  rax, [rbp - 0x60] Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  **RAX** => 0x7ffecb169b60 â—‚â€” 0

Â Â  0x5619b296832f <main+134>Â  Â  cmpÂ  Â  qword ptr [rbp - 0x68], rax Â  Â  0x7ffecb169b60 - 0x7ffecb169b60 Â  Â  EFLAGS => 0x246 [ cf **PF** af **ZF** sf **IF** df of ]

Â Â  0x5619b2968333 <main+138>Â  Â  **jne**Â  Â  main+174Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <main+174>

Â â–º **0x5619b2968335** **<main+140>**Â  Â  **lea**Â  Â  **rax****, [****rip** **+** **0xd4b****]**Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  **RAX** => 0x5619b2969087 â—‚â€” "\tThat's the right address!"

Â Â  0x5619b296833c <main+147>Â  Â  movÂ  Â  rdi, raxÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  **RDI** => 0x5619b2969087 â—‚â€” "\tThat's the right address!"

Â Â  0x5619b296833f <main+150>Â  Â  **call** Â  puts@pltÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <puts@plt>

Â Â  0x5619b2968344 <main+155>Â  Â  leaÂ  Â  rax, [rbp - 0x60]

Â Â  0x5619b2968348 <main+159>Â  Â  movÂ  Â  rdi, rax

Â Â  0x5619b296834b <main+162>Â  Â  **call** Â  get_flagÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <get_flag>

We know that user input is compared with the buffer address to determine whether the flag gets displayed. To do this, there must be a line that compares user input and the buffer address. This is the line at <main+134>, where the cmp operation is used. By tracing instructions <main+126> to <main+134>, we see that the user input is first put into rax, then transferred to QWORD PTR [rbp-0x68]. Then, whatever is in [rbp-0x60] gets put into rax. And then, we compare rax with QWORD PTR [rbp-0x68]. If we know QWORD PTR [rbp-0x68] contains user input, then by elimination, we can work out rax must contain the buffer address, which was obtained from [rbp-0x60]. We conclude that the buffer address is [rbp-0x60]. To find what this is, we must find out what the rbp register contains at this point in time. 

We find out rbp by setting a breakpoint just before user input is read, at <main+116>. Why? Because we know the program does not direct us to get_flag() after user input, which means we must set our breakpoint before user input (also such that after we find the buffer address, we can continue onto user input to input the answer). <main+116> is chosen because its rbp register contains the same thing as when user input is read. Its content has not changed. 

Set breakpoint at <main+116> and observe what the RBP register contains. Subtract 0x60 from it to obtain the flag's buffer address. Step through the program instruction by instruction using `next` . When user input is prompted, enter the buffer address. Eventually that will get us to the line where the flag gets printed. 

Done.

Goal: 
find the password by using GDB to debug and disassemble the code

Solve:
When prompted for the password the first time, enter anything. Soon a prompt appears "pwndbg" which allows you to run the gdb debugger. We will use gdb to step through the code, understand where the password gets stored and read its value.

Firstly, set a breakpoint on main using `b main` .Run the program by typing run. 

Get the assembly code by running disass. We see this particular line of interest indicating the instruction to call a function named "get_password".
- 0x0000561a096212c2 <+153>: call Â  0x561a09621333 <get_password>

We want to set a breakpoint on this function. To do this, notice "<+153>". This means relative to main, it is at an offset of +153. Therefore, we can run `b *(main+153)` to set this breakpoint. Then, run the program again. By calling convention, the returned value from a function that gets called gets stored in the rax register. It'd be helpful for us to see the value in rax at this point of the program, hopefully to read the value of the password. 

After reaching breakpoint main (1st breakpoint), run `continue`. This continues the program and you'll be prompted to enter the password. Enter anything. This will highly likely result in the wrong password. After this, we reach the second breakpoint where get_password is called. We run `next` to move on to the immediate next instruction after this function call. And we see something interesting: 

![[Captura de pantalla 2024-09-17 a las 9.08.33.png]]
The highlighted line in the screenshot reveals the password. 

The RSI register contains a memory address 0x55ec8c7b5010. This address contains the string that is our desired password. 

Run the program again and enter this password when prompted. Flag will be shown.

DONE.

## ðŸŸ¢ GDB 2 (100)
Goal:
find the flag somewhere. (no need to enter input this time)

Solve:
Set breakpoint at main and run `disass` to see the assembly code within main(). Observe the line where read_file function is called at <main+34>. Our hypothesis is that some file containing the flag is read here. The goal is to see the contents within the file.

To progress, let's set a breakpoint at the read_file function: `break *(main+34)` and run until this breakpoint. It'll give us more info about what happens here if we `disass` read_file. Run `disassemble /m read_file`. 

![[Captura de pantalla 2024-09-17 a las 13.11.13.png]]
Notice the entry that says <flag>. That seems like a point of interest. Let's set a breakpoint there as well: `break *(read_file+84)`

Continue stepping through the program, bringing us to the newly set breakpoint at *(read_file+84). 

At this point, begin stepping through the program instruction by instruction using `next`. 
When we arrive at **<read_file+91>** and we look at the registers, we notice that RSI contains the string "flag.txt". This confirms that the file that is being read indeed contains the flag. Continue stepping through the program because it seems like this file will get read soon. 

Eventually, at **<read_file+101>**, flag.txt's content gets loaded into RSI:
**RSI**Â  0x55770d149040 (flag) â—‚â€” 'flag{gl4d_y0u_f1gur3d_0ut_h0w_t0_f1nd_th3_fl4g!_96ff4618d6d22c03}\n'

There it is, the flag!

Done.
