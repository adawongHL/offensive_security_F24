Welcome to Introduction to Offensive Security. This is a crash course in Linux/C reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web hacking, and common cryptographic vulnerabilities. It expects some knowledge of programming fundamentals—such as data structures, object oriented programming, and C—and a general understanding of the Linux operating system and command line.

This course begins with a brief review of key operating systems concepts and then immediately dives into reverse engineering tools and techniques. After establishing a good reverse engineering foundation, we shift our focus to finding and exploiting software vulnerabilities. The binary exploitation sections introduce quintessential bug classes, starting with a basic stack overflow and expanding to modern glibc heap exploits. Next is a few lessons on web hacking that focus on hands-on exploitation of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and SQL injection. Finally, we conclude with common cryptographic vulnerabilities and how to exploit them to break randomization and encryption.

Each lesson contains a variety of walkthroughs to reinforce concepts along with practical examples to practice the skills taught in the lesson. By the end of the course, you will not just philosophically understand topics like X86 assembly, ROP chains, and XSS, but will have practical experience throwing _actual_ exploits!

Let's get started!
