Initial observations
- Chal description: "second-stage payload" implies 
- read request headers: 
	- `casette_path: "cassettes/wargames.webm"`
		- There is a folder called cassettes that contains the videos (.webm)
	- and my cookie `CHALBROKER_USER_ID: "hw3172`
- Behaviour when you request resources one after another
	- ✨ Request POST header: you have 2 separate `casette_path`
		- One of it is the path of the previous resource you were looking at
		- The second one is the path to the newly requested video...
		- HMMMMM SUSSS! This is tracing previous old and new states
		- How can this be vulnerable:
			- Chat says:
				- Server-side logic: could involve replacing the resource in the cookie with the new value sent in the body, updating the state to `wargames.webm` after processing the request.
				- It's possible that this could be part of a **vulnerability** if the server doesn't validate the state properly, allowing a user to manipulate the request to bypass certain restrictions, change the resource being accessed, or even **attempt path traversal**.
- No query params seen in URL --> Not a GET
	- We send POST
- View page source
	- ✨ the video display's src param is so sus. It's a whole file. I click into it and it's all 亂碼
		- Structure: src=" `data:[<mediatype>][;base64],<data>`"
			- The data is the whole video...; here, it's displayed as a base64-encoded string 
			- if the video data is literally here, can't I modify it?? (change it to malicious code)
		- Ideas:
			- what is this base64? base64 encoded the video bytes??d

Questions
- What language is this webpage in? Php? Js?
- Are all cassettes contained within the folder?
	- 
- Any differences between the categories?
Guesses
- 1. Web exploit; pop a shell on the webserver
- 2. request a secret resource by messing w request 
	- Seems more reasonable than LFI now bc this website has no file upload button...
	- I can select the provided categories, but I can also customize in my POST
	- !!! wait, when I submit a category, I'm sending a POST not GET request...to create a resource on the server??? "GET only retrieves data from a server while POST can modify or update server-side resources"
		- Ok so I can either: modify existing server-side resource OR upload my own video
			- Bc there is no video upload button, I think it's more likely that I mess with the video data. After I inject malicious code into them, I can launch the website and request the the corrupted video and pop a shell.
				- Search: web exploit to inject code into server resources
- 3. send a malicious file that gets rendered and code is executed (>> pop a shell)
	- Seems to fit this website. It's serving videos. If I serve a file that stays on the server and I request for that file, it will be rendered and malicious code can be run to pop a web-shell
	- But there's no place for me to upload a file?
Action Steps
- How to pop a reverse shell? tutorial
	- wk 10 locale infiltrator (Local file inclusion and web-shell)
		- Steps
			- poke around, observe
			- Try obvious filepaths: index.php, flag.php, ../flag.php (parent folder)
				- Try to scope out directory structures
			- Inspect src code 
				- Trace how uploads are processed 
	- Oh lmao so a web-shell is a shell you can interact with on the BROWSER. I thought it was some complicated shit where you first inject the file and then use your terminal to somehow nc the remote server and get the shell here...
