### 🟢 Are you alive: server edition (5) (DONE)
<u>Solve: </u>
Input the line ```nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1237``` into the terminal. Enter the Net ID. The OSIRIS server at port 1237 responds with the flag. 


### 🔴 Baby glibc (50)

Two files are given: 
- libc.so.6 
	- file that contains code from standard library
- baby_glibc
	- a program that uses functions from standard library glibc
	- memory addr for these functions are set as 0 because they are yet unknown

<u>Solve Attempt #1:</u>
After running `nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1235` in the terminal, the OSIRIS server asks "Can you tell me the address of the sleep() function?"

The sleep() function is a standard library function from glibc used in the file baby_glibc. To access its memory address, consult the symbol table of libc.so.6

Run ```readelf -Ws libc.so.6 | grep sleep``` in the terminal to show the symbol table of the file libc.so.6 and filter for entries including the word "sleep".
![[Captura de pantalla 2024-09-09 a las 15.36.57.png]]

How do I know which one is the sleep() function? Look at the last column for the name. The last entry is the one. Sending to the server "0x00000000000ea570" (0x at the start because server expects hex) does not work. The reason is that this program randomizes where things get loaded into memory, so the value column of the symbol table in libc.so.6 actually shows the offset from the base memory address. 

Recall the equation actual memory address of object = base address + object's offset.

To find find the actual memory address of the sleep() function, we must first find where glibc gets loaded into memory:

![[Captura de pantalla 2024-09-09 a las 22.49.45.png]]

From this, the glibc library gets loaded in at 0x0000000000029dc0

Therefore, the sleep function will be at:
0x29dc0 + 0xea570 = 0x114330
^ incorrect answer??

Also, glibc version 2.2.5 is used. This is found by looking at the symbol table of baby_glibc to see which version of glibc it's borrowing functions from. 

**Solve Attempt 2:**
Given:
I found glibc's `printf` function address written on a post-it note: ?|f
Agh! raw bytes again!

Solve: 
Strategy is as follows:
1. Parse the raw bytes sent from OSIRIS server to obtain glibc's printf function's absolute memory address
	1. write a Python script using pwntools to decode the bytes
	2. ^ ENCOUNTER PROBLEM: error when installing pwntools on local machine (ARM mac M3)
		1. Trying to build and run Docker --> running into error as well...
2. Find offset of printf function from libc.so.6's symbol table
3. Calculate base addr = printf's absolute addr - printf's offset
4. Find sleep function's offset from libc.so.6's symbol table
5. sleep function's absolute memory addr = base addr + sleep function's offset
6. DONE!



### 🟢 Vault 0 (50) (DONE)

](https://emojipedia.org/large-green-circle)
Goal: find the memory address of the secret vault.
No PIE. This means all memory addresses are absolute memory addresses, not offsets.

<u>Solve:</u>
Run ```readelf -Ws vault0```. Look for the entry for the secret vault, where name = secret_vault.

On line 38, we see:
38: 0000000000401236    21 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   15 secret_vault

This means the address for the secret vault is at 0x401236
Convert this to decimal, becoming: 4198966

Send that to the OSIRIS server. Flag captured!
flag{Th3_g00d_0ld_d4ys_0f_N0_PIE!_45c85d71aaa647f0}


### 🟢  Vault 1 (50) (DONE)
**Given:** 
Can you still find the address of the secret vault?
This time, PIE is activated. This means the value column shows offsets, not absolute memory addresses of things.
- Do you remember all that info about PIE?
- `nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1231`
- But I found this base address 0x5616cd0fc000 on a post-it note!
(note: base addr changes every time)


**Solve:**
Run ```readelf -Ws vault1``` to see the symbol table of the file vault1
Look for the entry for the secret vault:

38: 0000000000001249    26 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   16 secret_vault

0x1249 shows the offset of secret_vault.

Then, the secret_vault's absolute memory address can be calculated as follows:
- secret_vault's offset + base addr = 0x1249 + 0x5616cd0fc000 = 0x5616cd0fd249

### 🟢  Vault 2 (50) (DONE)
**Given:**
- `nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1232`
**Goal:**
- Find address of secret_vault

**Solve:** 
The provided fake vault address 0x5648602f4029 is the absolute address of fake vault. Subtract from it the fake vault's offset (see symbol table of vault2 for fake vault's entry: 0x4029) to obtain the base address:
- base address = 0x5648602f4029 - 0x4029 = 0x5648602f0000
The absolute address of secret vault is:
- base address + secret_vault's offset = 0x5648602f0000 + 0x1269 = 0x5648602f1269
Submit 0x5648602f1269 to obtain the flag.

Note:
The following challenges and baby glibc are unsolved because I'm struggling to run my python script (inside of which uses pwntools) within the docker container


### 🔴 Vault 3 (50)
Given: 
- `nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1233`
- involves raw bytes
- Can you still find the address of the secret vault?
I found this base address written on a post-it note: 8? V
Agh! But this time the address is in raw bytes!

### 🔴 Glibc (100)
Given: 
- Let's practice one more time finding GLIBC symbols!
- `nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1236`

### 🔴 Vault 4 (100)
Given: 
- `nc offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu 1234`
Can you still find the address of the secret vault?

  

I found this fake vault at: 0?p

                               ?U

But it doesn't appear to be the right one.

Agh! and the vault coordinates are in raw bytes!
